# About Me

## Welcome To My Page! :wave:

Thanks for viewing my portfolio! I am a full-stack developer that is currently based in Colorado (soon to be in Washington). I'm a big lover of video games :emoji:, traveling :emoji:, shooting (guns & bows) :emoji:, and sports :emoji:. Before pursuing a career in sofware development I was in the Army as a transportation management coordinator. After that, I worked logistics in the aerospace industy and also worked for TSA!
